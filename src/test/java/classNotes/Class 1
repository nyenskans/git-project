                                Git & GitHub

Review

1.What is Git?
It is a version control tool

2.What is a local repository?
A storage on our local machine

3.What is a remote repository?
Storage on the internet (on remote server) - GitHub

4.Architecture of Git:
Stage architecture --> Working Directory; Staging area, Repository

Working Directory -->

5.Where should you create your local repository?

Ideally you should create your repo inside your working directory (your project)


* One repository is required for each project


        -- Git commands --

 - pwd - shows current location
 - ls - shows directories within the current location
 - cd 'directory name' - navigate to a specific directory
 - git init - initializes an empty local repository
 - git status - shows the status of all files (whether they are tracked (moved to staging area) to be committed or not)
 - --> tracked are green, untracked are red
 - git add . - add all untracked files to the staging area
 - git add 'fileName' - add a specific file to the staging area
 - "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage files



* Project --> right click --> Open in --> Terminal
* Click on Terminal in the bottom left of console
* Navigate to Project in Finder --> right click --> New Terminal at Folder


Tracking a new project using git:

1. Determine what is the location where a repository should be created and navigate to that directory in terminal

2. git init --> to initialize an empty local repository

* to delete a local repo, delete a hidden .git folder in the project folder (command+shift+. to show hidden files)

3. git add . --> add all files to the Staging area to track them to be committed
** we don't have to commit all the changes into the repository right away. We can keep them in staging area,
make additional changes and only then commit them
(Note - in this case, those changes will override the tracked files in staging area)

4. git commit -m 'name that is related to the code we're working on'
--> the files we committed are moved from the staging area to the local repo
-- they contain a name, date, author, and the code

** at this point, git status command will show 'Nothing to commit' --> no files changed, no files in the staging area
