5.Where should you create your local repository?

Ideally you should create your repo inside your working directory (your project)


* One repository is required for each project


        -- Git commands --

 - pwd - shows current location
 - ls - shows directories within the current location
 - cd 'directory name' - navigate to a specific directory
 - git init - initializes an empty local repository
 - git status - shows the status of all files (whether they are tracked to be committed or not)
 - --> tracked are green, untracked are red
 - git add . - add all untracked files


* Project --> right click --> Open in --> Terminal
* Click on Terminal in the bottom left of console
* Navigate to Project in Finder --> right click --> New Terminal at Folder


Tracking a new project using git:

1. Determine what is the location where a repository should be created and navigate to that directory in terminal
2. git init --> to initialize an empty local repository

* to delete a local repo, delete a hidden .git folder in the project folder (command+shift+. to show hidden files)
